Core JavaScript Topics for React
ES6+ Features

Arrow Functions: Used extensively in functional components and event handlers.

Destructuring: Critical for props, state, and object/array manipulation (e.g., const { propName } = props).

Spread/Rest Operators: For immutable state updates (e.g., [...array], { ...obj }).

Template Literals: Dynamic strings (e.g., class names).

Modules (import/export): Organizing React components into files.

let/const vs. var: Block-scoped variables for state management.

Array Methods

map(): Rendering lists in JSX (e.g., {items.map(item => <Component />)}).

filter()/reduce(): Data transformations and state updates.

find()/some()/every(): Conditional logic in components.
Asynchronous JavaScript

Promises & async/await: Fetching data from APIs (e.g., useEffect with async operations).

Error handling with try/catch.

Functions and Scope

Closures: Understanding how state is preserved in hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).

Higher-Order Functions (HOFs): Used in React patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

Callback Functions: Passing functions as props (e.g., event handlers).

Objects and Immutability

Immutable updates: Avoid direct mutation (critical for React state, Redux, etc.).

Reference vs. value: Avoid unintended side effects in state.

Event Handling

DOM events in vanilla JS (e.g., onClick, onChange) to understand Reactâ€™s synthetic events.

Functional Programming Basics

Pure functions: Predictable UI components.

Side effects: Managed via useEffect in React.

Advanced Topics (Optional but Helpful)
Classes (Legacy React)

Class components (less common with hooks) and lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount).

The this Keyword

Relevant for class components and older React codebases.

Prototypes/Inheritance

Less critical for React (composition > inheritance), but good for JS fundamentals.

JSON

Parsing API responses (e.g., fetch() + .json()).

Web APIs

fetch(), localStorage, and timers (setTimeout/setInterval).

Type Checking

typeof, instanceof, and optional tools like TypeScript for type safety.

Ecosystem Tools
Package Managers (npm/yarn)

Installing React and libraries (e.g., npm create vite@latest).

Bundlers (Webpack/Vite)

Understand how React apps are built and bundled.

Testing (Jest/React Testing Library)

Writing tests for React components.

React-Specific Patterns to Learn After JS Basics
JSX: HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.

Components (Functional vs. Class): Start with functional components + hooks.

State Management: useState, useReducer, Context API, or external libraries (Redux).

Hooks: useEffect, useContext, useMemo, useCallback, etc.

Component Lifecycle: Managed via hooks like useEffect.
